# Description:
This Python script implements a simple keylogger using the ```pynput``` library. Keylogging is a technique used to monitor and record keystrokes on a computer. The script captures keypress events and writes them to a log file named "log.txt". It also handles special keys such as space, enter, backspace, control, and shift, ensuring they are represented correctly in the log file.

# Features:
* Records keystrokes in real-time.
* Handles special keys to ensure accurate representation in the log.
* Logs keystrokes to a file for later analysis.
* Seamless termination of the keylogger.

# Caution:
* Use this script responsibly and ethically. Keylogging can potentially violate privacy laws and policies.
* Ensure that you have proper authorization before using this script on any system.
* Be aware of the legal implications of monitoring or recording keystrokes on computers.

# Install the required library:
~~~
pip install pynput
~~~
# Run the script using Python:
~~~
python keylogger.py
~~~
* The keylogger will start capturing keystrokes immediately and logging them to "log.txt".
* To stop the keylogger, terminate the script execution.
# Note:
* Use this script responsibly and ethically.
* Ensure you have proper authorization before using it on any system.
* Be aware of the legal implications of monitoring or recording keystrokes on computers.
